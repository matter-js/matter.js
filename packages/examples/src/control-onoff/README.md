> matter.js as library, along with all related tools (such as the Shell app) and examples, is not certified by the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA). They are provided solely to demonstrate the capabilities of our solution and to support testing and development.  Using matter.js does not certify your product â€” Connectivity Standards Alliance membership and product certification are required to release official Matter devices. For more details, see [A note on certification](https://github.com/matter-js/matter.js/blob/main/README.md#a-note-on-certification).

This is an example of a simple Matter controller.  A "controller" is a device that can add another device to a Matter
network.  This process is called "commissioning".

In this case the device can add another device that supports the "on/off" cluster and toggle it on or off.
