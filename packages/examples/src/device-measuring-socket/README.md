# Socket device that reports random Energy and Power measurements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> matter.js as library, along with all related tools (such as the Shell app) and examples, is not certified by the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA). They are provided solely to demonstrate the capabilities of our solution and to support testing and development.  Using matter.js does not certify your product â€” Connectivity Standards Alliance membership and product certification are required to release official Matter devices. For more details, see [A note on certification](https://github.com/matter-js/matter.js/blob/main/README.md#a-note-on-certification).

This example shows how to run a simple socket device that also includes a power and energy measurement. It is not configurable via CLI and only sets random energy and power values when turned on.


## Usage

For general documentation about the CLI parameters or environment variables that can be used for matter.js please refer to the [Examples README](../../../examples/README.md#cli-usage).

Execute the following command in the examples root directory

```bash
npm run matter-measuredsocket
```
