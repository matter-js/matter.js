/**
 * This example is not optimized for simplicity, but to show all the advanced use cases for matter.js.
 * If you want to see a simple minimalistic and more standard example please look at DeviceNode.ts or the other examples.
 *
 * This example shows how to create a simple on-off Matter device as a light or as a socket.
 * It can be used as CLI script and starting point for your own device node implementation.
 * Additional to this it shows the following:
 * * How to modify the existing clusters on Root and also Device Endpoints
 * * How to add own Cluster implementations for Standard clusters
 * * How to add a custom Cluster to an Endpoint
 * * Which events are available to get status information from the Node aon commissioning and session/subscription changes
 * * How to get cluster state values
 * * How to set one or multiple state values in a transaction.
