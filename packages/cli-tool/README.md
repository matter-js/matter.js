> [!IMPORTANT]
> matter.js as library, along with all related tools (such as the Shell app) and examples, is not certified by the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA). They are provided solely to demonstrate the capabilities of our solution and to support testing and development.  Using matter.js does not certify your product â€” Connectivity Standards Alliance membership and product certification are required to release official Matter devices. For more details, see [A note on certification](https://github.com/matter-js/matter.js/blob/main/README.md#a-note-on-certification).

This is a matter.js-based command line utility for interacting with Matter.

Once installed use the `matter` command to start an interactive command line.  This tool is self documenting;
use the `help` command for further instructions.
