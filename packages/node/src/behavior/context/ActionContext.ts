/**
 * Provides contextual information for Matter actions such as accessing attributes or invoking commands.
 *
 * Matter.js provides an "online" ActionContext for you when responding to network requests.  You can also use
 * "offline" agents to invoke cluster APIs {@link Endpoint} without an active user session.
 *
 * See {@link RemoteActorContext} and {@link LocalActorContext} for details of these two types of interaction.
 *
 * Context includes:
 *
 *   - Authorization details such as {@link AccessLevel}, {@link subject} and accessing {@link fabric}
 *
 *   - The {@link transaction} required to make state changes
 *
 *   - Factory functions for {@link Agent} instances you can use to interact with {@link Endpoint}s
 *
 *   - When responding to network requests, low-level contextual information such as the wire {@link message}
 *
 * For the formal definition of an "action" see {@link MatterSpecification.v12.Core} ยง 8.2.4
